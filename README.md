Hello! I am Hillary, a math and computer science student at Wittenberg University.
Freshman year I recieved an award that allowed me to do research with a c.s. professor on campus and here is the code from that final research.

Research topic:
We used a dataset of 1000 movies from IMDB and facts about them (director, rating, etc.) and used different classification algrotithms in Python to see which one would create the best predictive model.
We also utilized the 3D graph function available in Python to create different graphs to show the accuracy of each model. 
Some algorithms we tested were KNeighbors, ExtraTrees, and DecisionTree.
For our dataset, the DecisionTree classifier was most accurate at making predictions.
