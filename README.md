# IMDB Movie Classification Research
## Overview
This project explores a dataset of 1000 IMDb movies to identify patterns and predict movie attributes using various machine learning classifiers. Our main goal was to determine which algorithm provides the most accurate predictions.

## Research Objectives
To compare the performance of different classification algorithms.
To visualize the accuracy of each model using 3D graphs in Python.

## Methodology
We utilized several classifiers like KNeighbors, ExtraTrees, and DecisionTree. The dataset included movie attributes such as director, rating, etc. Our analysis involved data cleaning, model training, and result evaluation.

## Results
The DecisionTree classifier outperformed others in terms of accuracy. Detailed comparisons and performance metrics are included.

## Visualizations
Graphs illustrating the accuracy comparisons of each model provide insights into their predictive power.

## Challenges and Learnings
We had to modify the code to be able to handle movies with no input in certain categories (i.e. if no world gross was provided). 

## Future Work
I am interested to see if the DecisionTree classifier is most accurate for all IMDB datasets and why that is. 
I also wonder what other datasets the DecisionTree would be best at making predictive models for.
